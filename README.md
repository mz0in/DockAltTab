# Install Instructions:

-   Grant Accessibility & Input Monitoring permissions, it will then ask for Automation.
    -   After Input Monitoring is granted, if the downloads folder is on the dock, clicking it will also produce a prompt for Files & Folders permissions
-   NOTE: &nbsp; [AltTab](https://github.com/steventheworker/alt-tab-macos/releases/) must be running before launching
-   Optional: &nbsp; (**Firefox users** ONLY): &nbsp; to better ignore Picture-In-Picture windows, DockAltTab must also be granted "Screen Recording" permissions [(used to verify window title isn't "Picture-In-Picture")](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/126860#398314022)
